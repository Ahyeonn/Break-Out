# Break-Out
This is a Javascript game called Break-out where users can control a paddle to hit the ball in order to break the bricks. Before the game is over, the user has a total of 3 lives to build up their score by breaking the stacked bricks. When the user breaks all of the bricks, the user wins the game. This game was created for the ACS 1320, ‘Javascript Foundations’ class, and I used the linter called Eslint for the first time to correct my Javascript code in a professional manner.
